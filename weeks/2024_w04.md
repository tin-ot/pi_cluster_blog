## Technical

### GNS3

Managed to make basic mikrotik connectivity in GNS3. Managed to get a couple of other appliance images.

I don't want to spend too much time in this direction for the moment. But it's nice to have.

### K8s

Manage the have a working inventory. Not much more. I need to read the doc about the different blocs of a cluster, etcd, certificate ...

Seems like next step is to have a CA. I want to be a generic process to include new elements in the PKI. At least for now to have a "new VPN certificate" and a "new K8s node" feature.

## Issues

The fans of the cluster are too noisy. It gives server room vibes. Would be good in closet, yet the cluster is in the living room.

## Procurements

Revieved Uctronics cluster case. Nice.

- [] Purchase cables and SSD + cooler

## Next Week objective

- [] More docs about K8s blocs
- [] Docs about PKI automation
- [] Doc PCIe
