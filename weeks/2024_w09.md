## Technical

Managed to boot from ZFS sdcard.

Not effortless. Maybe try MAAS and consider automation to setup zfs bootable ? or boot ext4 for ever and only manage data with zfs.

Very user friendly to backup restore on same disk. Need to try from distant server next

## Issues

Some network regressions. No DNS entry for nodes mostly but lost 1h to find the ips.

## Procurements

received SSD + cable

## Next Week objective

- [x] boot on zfs for node001
- [ ] zfs boot from SSD
- [ ] think about a draft backup plan for current setup
- [ ] Play with k8s , minikube etc.
