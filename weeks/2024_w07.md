## Technical

Didn't configured much. Only docs.

Found out about [kubespray](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray) to deploy k8s with ansible. That will be the chosen deployment tool.

Took a step back on k8s. Re-watch more basic stuff on deployments, config maps, loadbalancers etc. Need more time to finish them.

Read also about distributed database theory. Got a better understanding of the CAP theorem. Got really intrigued by FoundationDB and a distributed it's ACID capabilities.

Took a lot of time also to read about wifi and upcomoing new house setup.

## Issues

Poor time management.

## Procurements

Budget caused stand by on storage procurements. Paused also until having a good overview on a backup plan. Most likely using zfs.

- [ ] CAP ( Mikrotik CAP ax ? )

On pause for PCIe pi5 nvme adapter and SSD for pi4

## Next Week objective

- [ ] Setup minkube and try basic tuto
- [x] Read docs on zfs and backup plans
- [ ] try hello world kubespray
  
CA for later.
